# CodeRabbit Integration – Usage Results & Evaluation

## Overview

This document summarizes the **actual usage and results** of integrating **CodeRabbit (AI-powered code review)** into the *Insurance Claim Records Management System* repository (personal repo within personal account).
CodeRabbit review it own configuration file .coderabbit.yaml

The objective was to evaluate how CodeRabbit behaves **in real conditions**, both:

* **Before a Pull Request** (IDE integration)
* **During a Pull Request** (GitHub PR review)

---

## Integration Status

* CodeRabbit successfully integrated
* Repository access granted via: [https://app.coderabbit.ai/login](https://app.coderabbit.ai/login)
* `.coderabbit.yaml` configuration file added in `dev` branch
* CodeRabbit bot active on Pull Requests
* IDE extension tested (VS Code)

---

## 1. IDE-Level Review (Before Pull Request)

When used as an **IDE extension (VS Code)**, CodeRabbit performs **local static analysis** before opening a PR.

### Example Feedback (IDE)

**Issue detected: Line endings**

> Fix line ending characters to use Unix-style (LF)

* Detected Windows-style CRLF line endings
* Provided **exact fix instructions to do**

**Value:**
Early feedback before committing code, reducing unnecessary PR review cycles.

---

## 2. Pull Request Review (GitHub Integration)

After creating a Pull Request,CodeRabbit do automatically reviewed the changes and posted comments directly on the PR.

### PR Summary Generated by CodeRabbit

> **Chores**
> Added development tooling configuration to standardize code review workflows and establish quality standards across the project.

CodeRabbit actively validated the configuration file and reported **schema-level issues**, even before (IDE) also afer (PR) reviewing application code.

#### A. Incorrect YAML Structure

**Issue:**

* `tools` section placed at the root level

**CodeRabbit Feedback:**

> tools section is at the wrong YAML level and won't be applied.

**Proposed Fix:**

* Move `tools` under `reviews` section
* Provided **ready-to-apply YAML diff**

**Value:**
Prevents misconfiguration that would otherwise go unnoticed.

---

#### B. Unsupported Custom Fields

The following custom fields were added for contextual guidance:

* `project_context`
* `additional_instructions`

**CodeRabbit Feedback:**

> These properties are not part of the official schema and are ignored.

**What CodeRabbit Did Well:**

* Clearly explained **why** they are ignored
* Did **not fail** the build
* Suggested **correct alternatives**:

  * Move context into `reviews.path_instructions`
  * Apply instructions per file path (`**/*.java`, `batch/**`, `service/**`)

✅ **Value:**
Helps align custom documentation with CodeRabbit’s supported configuration model.

* Posted **3 actionable comments**
* Each comment included:

  * Severity level (🟠 Major)
  * Explanation
